# MERN Auth System with 2FA

This project is a full-stack authentication and authorization system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), with a strong focus on security best practices and two-factor authentication (2FA). It serves as a reference implementation for building secure, scalable, and modern auth systems in JavaScript-based applications.

## Use Cases

-  Bootstrapping secure authentication for modern web apps
-  Learning and practicing security implementations in full-stack development
-  Serving as a foundation for production-ready auth systems with 2FA
